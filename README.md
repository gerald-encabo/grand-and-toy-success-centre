## Grand & Toy - Success Centre

The main highlight project I have worked on with Grand & Toy is the current homepage which is called Project Revive. The homepage is designed by hired creative agency which they provide all the detailed information including wireframes on Adobe XD and mockups on Figma.

For this project, I have worked with a Backend developer, UX designer, QA tester, Marketing, and other stakeholders. The requirement for this project is to work on eight components including building six brand-new reusable components and modifying two existing components which are the Navbar and Footer. For the new components, I have worked with CMS Contentstack where I organized the structure of the components.

The technology used for building and modifying these components is HTML5, CSS3 SASS, Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Owl Carousel, JSON, ASP.NET Razor, and GitHub.
